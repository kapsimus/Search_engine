 One of the things that's most fun about playing a competitive online Action RPG is taking part in a levelling race on a fresh server. In Path of Exile, we wanted to capture this feeling without constantly resetting our main economy, so we've created a set of race leagues that are run frequently as separate game worlds with their own ladders and economies.
In addition to regular races, leagues can substantially modify the game rules. In an Ancestral league, ancient totems exist alongside groups of monsters, augmenting their abilities. In Turbo leagues, monsters move and attack 60% faster than normal
