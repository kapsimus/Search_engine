We have released a new version of Kirac's Vault Pass that contains unique item skin rewards that are exclusive to this league! Each of these rewards visually interacts with gameplay in some way and will leave the store forever when the Sanctum League ends. After purchasing the pass, you can earn its rewards in the Atlas endgame by completing map objectives. Check out the Kirac's Vault page for more information!
